### Hello I am Robert, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹
I am currently studying the Masters programme in [Quantitative Finance at the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel](http://www.studservice.uni-kiel.de/sta/fachpruefungsordnung-quantitative-finance-master-1-fach.pdf#page=8), SH Germany.
Here on Github I am hosting all kinds of little own projects, files and concepts from my various university modules.
### Various academic works of mine are present too:
Bachelor thesis: [Is liquidity risk still priced in the cross-section of US stocks?](https://github.com/RobertHennings/BachelorThesis/blob/main/Thesis%20Robert%20Hennings%202021%20Eng.pdf)
Seminar paper: Are dividends actually disappearing? - Global evidence
Seminar paper: Artificial neural networks (ANN) in business and technology
